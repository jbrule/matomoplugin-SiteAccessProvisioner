## Documentation

The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Matomo Marketplace](https://plugins.matomo.org/).
After activation go to General Settings and set a SharedSecret. You will then need to implement an access provider (example code available in README) which will generate a link for users to use to access Matomo.
